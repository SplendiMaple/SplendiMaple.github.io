**How to fix vsc docker connection failure?**

***

# Error 

>Failed to connect. Is Docker running?
    Error: connect EACCES /var/run/docker.sock

*Useally, if /var/run/docker.sock is not touched, the permissions are as follows.*

```bash
srw-rw---- 1 root docker 0  4ì›”  9 15:31 /var/run/docker.sock
```
*It's just a problem that VSC cannot access docker.sock, which you just need to change the access rights as follows.*



```bash
sudo chmod a+x /var/run/docker.sock
```

*As aside as, if you run the code below on another site and it doesn't work, check it out.*

```bash
    sudo usermod -a -G docker $USER
```
*Check group docker.sock access right*

*Since the access permission is set to rw-------(600), there is a high probability that it will not work.*
